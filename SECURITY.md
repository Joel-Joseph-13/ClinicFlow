## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in this project, please report it by following the instructions below:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed email with the subject line "Vulnerability Report" to:  
   [joel1family4@gmail.com]  
   or alternatively, create a GitHub issue in the repository for initial disclosure. Do **not** publicly share sensitive information until the issue is resolved.

2. **Expected Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **3 business days**. After that, we will evaluate the issue and begin working on a fix.

3. **What to Expect**:
   - If the vulnerability is valid, we will work on a fix and release a security update in the next available project version.
   - If the issue is not considered a vulnerability or does not affect the current version, we will explain our reasoning and suggest any possible workarounds if applicable.

4. **Confidentiality**: All reported vulnerabilities will be handled confidentially, and we will work directly with the reporter until the issue is resolved. Public disclosure will only occur once a fix is made available or if the reporter has consented.
